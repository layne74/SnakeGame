## Description

Just a simple snake Game. Always wanted to make a Snake game with Vanilla JS. Works using CSS grid for positioning and interval for the games frame ticking.

## Installation

Download the zip file/clone and open the HTML.

## How to play

You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to direct the snake. Collect food and dont collide with yourself. Both the top and bottom walls can be used to reach the opposite side.

If you feel that is too much effort, fair enough you can play it [here](https://snake-game-ashen.vercel.app/) on vercel.
